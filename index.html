  <h1>Income & Expenses Tracker – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 27 November 2025</div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Income & Expenses Tracker</strong> (“the App”)
      developed by <strong>John Shiburah</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
      handles your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Income & Expenses Tracker is a personal finance app that helps you track income,
      expenses, budgets and view simple analytics on your own device.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Income & Expenses Tracker does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account
      and does <strong>not</strong> automatically collect any personal
      information from you.
    </p>
    <p>The only data stored by the App is what you choose to enter, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Income records (amount, source, date, notes)</li>
      <li>Expense records (amount, category, item description, notes, date)</li>
      <li>Budget settings and notes</li>
      <li>App preferences (e.g., currency symbol, custom categories, emojis)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or physical address (unless you enter them yourself in notes)</li>
      <li>Your contacts, messages, photos, or other phone data</li>
      <li>Your location data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored and Used</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into Income & Expenses Tracker is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stored locally on your device and on your google drive. The developer has no access to your data.</strong> (using local/google drive storage only)</li>
      <li>Used only inside the App to:
        <ul>
          <li>Show income and expense history</li>
          <li>Calculate totals, balances, and budget progress</li>
          <li>Generate charts and analytics within the App</li>
          <li>Export your income/expense records to an Excel (.xlsx) file when you choose</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> upload your data to our own servers.
      If you export or share files (for example to email, cloud storage or
      messaging apps), those services will handle the data under their
      own privacy policies, not ours.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell your data</li>
      <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
      <li>Track you across other apps or websites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App may use third-party libraries (for example, for file access,
      charts, or sharing files), but these operate only on your device and
      do not send your personal finance data to us.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request permissions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage / File access</strong> – to save exported Excel
        files and allow you to share them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only for the stated purposes and are not
      used to access any data unrelated to the App’s features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Data Security &amp; Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you uninstall the App, reset your phone, or lose your device,
        your data may be lost unless you have manually exported or backed
        it up.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are responsible for keeping your device and any exported Excel
        files secure (for example, using screen lock, device encryption,
        or storing exported files in secure locations).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We encourage you to export and back up your data regularly if it is
      important to you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Income & Expenses Tracker is designed for general use and is not specifically
      targeted at children.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you
      believe a child has provided personal information within the App
      that you want removed, please contact us at the email below.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because the data is stored only on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can view, edit, or delete your records directly in the App at any time.</li>
      <li>You can delete all data by uninstalling the App and/or clearing the App’s data from your device settings.</li>
      <li>You can export your data to Excel for your own use, backup, or analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not maintain a copy of your data on any server, so we cannot
      restore data you delete or lose on your device.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we
      will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend you review this policy periodically to stay informed
      about how your information is handled.
    </p>
  </div>
